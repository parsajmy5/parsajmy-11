        <section>
        The account delivery time by the Persian Juggernaut store is a maximum of 24 business hours.
        The second and third capacity accounts are guaranteed as long as there is no change in Sony's console sharing policies,
        but the first capacity account is only guaranteed for 24 hours from the moment of purchase.
        The third capacity account does not have the right to be active as a primary account as a second capacity.
        The user does not have the right to edit the account, including changing the password, online ID, etc. If it is found,
        the person's access will be revoked from the account and the money will not be refunded.
        
        The user does not have the right to use wallets, credit cards, etc., and if used,
        it will be followed up by Persian Juggernaut support and the customer's account will be revoked.
        In case of mutual deletion of messages in Telegram,
        no services will be provided to the user and the account will be out of warranty.
        The user has no right to save two-step codes.
        
        To properly activate the warranty, the user is required to send a picture of the disabled or inactive
        account for the third capacity account within 24 hours of receiving the account,
        and for the second capacity account, the user must send a picture of its enabled or active status.
        To enter each capacity account, a support will give you a code up to 3 times. If you do not enter the account 3 times,
        no refund will be given and the account will be taken from you.
        To enter each account, the capacity is 2 or 3, support sends the code up to 3 times. If you do not enter it 3 times,
        30 Tomans will be charged to resend the code up to 3 more times.
        If the code needs to be sent after a week of purchasing the account, the user is required to pay a fee to receive the code,
        and the fee will be calculated based on resale.
        
        Any user who uses any form of disrespect, profanity, threats, etc.
        will not receive any services from the Persian Juggernaut store.
        The money will not be refunded and the account will be revoked.
        Sending repeated messages will delay your response by up to 24 hours.
        First-capacity accounts are not resold. If a user deletes or signs out of their account and wants to log back in,
        it will be reviewed by Persian Juggernaut support and the account will be reissued after deducting the fee.
        
        The user's incorrect account entry process has nothing to do with Persian Juggernaut,
        and if possible, Persian Juggernaut will fix the problem with a 50% fee.
        If the user has a problem with the account for any reason, there is a fee for resending the code to the user.
        Due to currency fluctuations, prices may not be up to date. To be sure, you can contact Telegram support.

        <span><pre id="h2">about us</pre></span>
        Persian Juggernaut was proudly created by an Iranian student named Parsa Jamshidian,
        and I hope that it will become a completely legal
        and reputable site in the coming years.
